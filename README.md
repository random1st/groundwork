# groundwork

Personal Claude Code plugin marketplace — `random1st/groundwork`.

Four plugins that turn a single AI session into a calibrated one — independent multi-model audit, cross-CLI delegation, a reasoning baseline, and an evidence-before-claim verification gate. Plus a project-agnostic `AGENTS.md` template that documents the discipline behind them.

No coupling to any personal runtime. Each plugin uses raw CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`) or standard Claude Code conventions.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add random1st/groundwork
/plugin install <plugin-name>@groundwork
```

Update later:

```text
/plugin marketplace update groundwork
```

## Plugins

### [tribunal](plugins/tribunal/)

Independent code review by two other AI CLIs. Whichever CLI you are running stays as the arbiter; the two others (any combo of Claude, Codex, Gemini) audit the code in parallel and you read both verdicts before deciding. Use for pre-merge reviews, security-critical code, and changes you don't want to ship alone.

### [delegate](plugins/delegate/)

Routing matrix for sending work to another AI CLI. Tells you which model and which reasoning effort to use for each task — code review, architecture analysis, whole-project scans, quick documentation. Uses raw `codex exec` and `gemini` binaries; no wrapper required.

### [fpf](plugins/fpf/)

Reasoning baseline. Frame the problem before solving: generate multiple competing hypotheses, derive testable predictions, run the tests, update what you believe. Every factual claim must carry an evidence tag — observed, specified, inferred, or speculative. Apply on any non-trivial problem.

### [verify](plugins/verify/)

Refuses to claim completion without proof. Identifies the command that would prove the claim, runs it fresh, reads the actual output, and reports PASS or FAIL with the evidence. Companion to the tag discipline in `fpf` — verification is what makes `[OBSERVED]` tags trustworthy.

## Template: AGENTS.md

[`templates/AGENTS.md`](templates/AGENTS.md) is one canonical instructions file usable by any agentic CLI. Same content, just copy to wherever your CLI looks:

- Codex → `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` or `<repo>/AGENTS.md`
- Claude Code → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`
- Gemini → `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` or `<repo>/GEMINI.md`

It includes the universal core (Constitution, Calibration, FPF, Protocol) plus a compact CLI Quick Reference covering native mechanics of all three CLIs.

## Prerequisites

`tribunal` and `delegate` shell out to `codex` and `gemini` CLIs. Install and authenticate them before use:

- [`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- [`gemini`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

`fpf` and `verify` are pure guidance — no external tooling needed.
